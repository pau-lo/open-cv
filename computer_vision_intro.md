## What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to see, interpret, and understand images or videos, just like humans do. It helps machines recognize objects, detect patterns, and make decisions based on visual data.

## How Does Computer Vision Work?

Computer vision works by processing images using these key steps:

1.  Image Acquisition – Capturing an image using a camera or importing an existing one.
2.  Preprocessing – Cleaning the image by adjusting brightness, removing noise, or resizing.
3.  Feature Extraction – Identifying key patterns, edges, shapes, and textures.
4.  Model Training – Using machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) algorithms like CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to recognize objects.
5.  Prediction & Decision Making – The trained model analyzes new images and makes predictions (e.g., "This is a cat").
